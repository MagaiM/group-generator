## Task:
Write a Python program which is able to generate groups from students.

## Requirements
1. Program shall work with different group sizes, size of the group shall be requested from the user as an terminal input. 
1. Program shall generate optimal groups, based on the following logic:
student who participated previously with another student, try not to put them into the same group
1. Program shall read the input file (input.txt), where students are listed in the same line means they had same group previously, e.g.:
Jhon, Marta, Liza
Marta, Thomas
Peter, Thomas
Jennifer
means (Jhon, Marta and Liza) and (Marta, Thomas) and (Peter, Thomas) had a common group and Jennifer had no group previously.
1. Program shall generate output (output.txt), where the optimal groups are listed, e.g.:
Thomas, Jhon
Marta, Peter
Liza, Jennifer
1. In case of multiple optimal groups, the program shall generate multiple output files (output_1.txt, output_2.txt, ...) containing each optimal group.
1. In case of no solution, the program shall generate an output file (output.txt) and write to the first line: "not possible to form groups"

## Deadline
Week A: 2021.10.24, end of day (23:59)
Week B: 2021.10.31, end of day (23:59)

## Soulution
Soultion shall be available in a github repository, and shall be presented the logic on 2021.10.25. Soultion will be tested with a module test, based on the requirements.

## Winners
Multiple winners are possible, and get a CHEAT CARD for the ProgBasics PA; in case of any obstacle in the PA, winner can ask a specific question and mentor will provide support. (not possible to ask not specific questions, e.g.: 'what is this', 'why not working', etc.)

UPDATE!
I will provide a :python:  code skeleton :python: soon, please use this for your implementation!
